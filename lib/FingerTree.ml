(*We are writing our own finger tree, instead of using the one at batteries, for performance reason.

  0 - Chunk the data structure for ultra performance

  1 - The root node should not store the measurement (due to frequent changes to it)

  2 - To inline the measurements monoid operation

  3 - Use laziness for the right big O in persistent setting

  Note that this is a tentative list, describing what we thought we want but not what we implemented.
*)

(*todo: The code in this paper is not meant to be production code.
  In a real implementation, weâ€™d have to be more careful with memory usage.
  In one place particular, where head, tail, and chop are used in the implementation of tail,
  a potential space leak exists (that can be remedied by strictness annotations).
  The actual implementation in Data.Sequence is very optimized and uses lots of strictness annotations.
  Another spot that can be optimized is the use of the (short) helper lists in the implementation of glue.
  In fact, they can be eliminated completely by specializing those functions,
  resulting in a lot of nested cases. (This is also done in Data.Sequence.)
  For the sake of explanation, this was not done here.
  Implementing glue without these helper lists and
  without excessive case analyses is still future work*)

(*one thing i dont like is how more0 match on the tree then call head (which match on the same tree again).
  might worth expanding all case so it only do 1 match.
